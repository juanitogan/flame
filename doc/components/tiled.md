# TiledComponent class

The `TiledComponent` class is a component for use in building a [`GameEntity`](/doc/game_entity.md).  Currently, Tiled support only renders the visible layers.  Other advanced features are not yet supported.

[Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/) is an awesome tool for building levels and maps.  The [Tiled package](https://pub.dev/packages/tiled) for Dart is included to parse Tiled's TMX files for map rendering.

**//TODO: the old version of this is working but this is slated to be rebuilt; will rewrite doc after that**
